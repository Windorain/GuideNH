# GameScene

`<GameScene>` is GuideNH's 3D preview tag. `<Scene>` is an alias with the same behavior.

## Scene Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `width` | integer | `256` | viewport width in pixels |
| `height` | integer | `192` | viewport height in pixels |
| `zoom` | float | `1.0` | camera zoom multiplier |
| `perspective` | string | `isometric-north-east` | camera preset |
| `rotateX` | float | auto | explicit X rotation override |
| `rotateY` | float | auto | explicit Y rotation override |
| `rotateZ` | float | auto | explicit Z rotation override |
| `offsetX` | float | auto | screen-space horizontal pan |
| `offsetY` | float | auto | screen-space vertical pan |
| `centerX` | float | auto | explicit world rotation center X |
| `centerY` | float | auto | explicit world rotation center Y |
| `centerZ` | float | auto | explicit world rotation center Z |
| `interactive` | boolean expression | `true` | enables mouse interaction |
| `allowLayerSlider` | boolean | `true` | shows the vertical layer slider |
| `gridButtonEnabled` | boolean | `true` | shows the floor grid toggle button |
| `showGrid` | boolean | `false` | initial visibility of the floor grid |

## Debug Mode Overlays

When the `enableDebugMode` option is enabled in the GuideNH mod config, the following extra
overlays become available in the 3D scene preview.

### Grid Coordinate Labels

When debug mode is **on** and the floor grid is **visible**, coordinate labels are rendered
below each grid line:

- **X-axis numbers** are shown along the near edge of the grid (north/−Z edge in the default
  `isometric-north-east` camera).  Each integer X world-coordinate receives a label.
- **Z-axis numbers** are shown along the near edge of the grid (east/+X edge).  Each integer
  Z world-coordinate receives a label.
- **Cardinal direction initials** (`N`, `S`, `E`, `W`) are drawn at the midpoint of each
  respective grid edge.

Coordinates follow the actual world X/Z values stored in the scene level, so they can be
negative when the structure contains blocks with negative coordinates.

The grid toggle button is **always enabled** while debug mode is active, regardless of the
`gridButtonEnabled` attribute, so you can show or hide the grid and its labels at any time.
The default grid visibility (`showGrid`) is not affected.

### Block Coordinate Tooltip

When debug mode is **on** and the cursor hovers over a block inside the scene, a second
tooltip is rendered above the primary block tooltip, showing the world-space block position
as `X, Y, Z` in gold text.

If the coordinate tooltip would be clipped at the top of the screen it automatically snaps
below the cursor area instead (magnetic snapping).

## Perspective Presets

Accepted `perspective` values:

- `isometric-north-east`
- `isometric-north-west`
- `up`

Unknown values fall back to `isometric-north-east`.

## Content Embedding and Text Wrapping

Any block-level tag — including `<GameScene>` — supports two optional attributes that control
how it is embedded in the page, mirroring Microsoft Word's "Text Wrapping" options.

| Attribute | Values | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `wrap` | `inline` · `square` · `tight` · `through` · `top-bottom` · `behind` · `front` | `inline` | Text-wrapping mode |
| `align` | `left` · `center` · `right` | `left` | Horizontal alignment |

### Wrap modes

| Mode | Word equivalent | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inline` | In line with text | Default flow: scene occupies its own vertical slot (嵌入型) |
| `square` | Square | Scene floats left or right; surrounding text wraps in a rectangle around it (方形环绕) |
| `tight` | Tight | Tighter wrap; equivalent to `square` in this layout system (紧密型) |
| `through` | Through | Through-wrap; equivalent to `square` in this layout system (穿越型) |
| `top-bottom` | Top and Bottom | Text only above and below, not beside; respects `align` for horizontal placement (上下型) |
| `behind` | Behind text | Block renders behind surrounding text; respects `align` (衬于文字下方) |
| `front` | In front of text | Block renders in front of surrounding text; respects `align` (浮于文字上方) |

### Examples

Left-floating scene — text in the next paragraph wraps to the right:

````md
<GameScene wrap="square" align="left" width="200" height="150">
  <Block id="minecraft:stone" />
</GameScene>

Text that flows to the right of the scene...
````

Right-floating scene:

````md
<GameScene wrap="square" align="right" width="200" height="150">
  <Block id="minecraft:stone" />
</GameScene>

Text that flows to the left of the scene...
````

Centred scene (no text wrapping):

````md
<GameScene align="center" width="200" height="150">
  <Block id="minecraft:stone" />
</GameScene>
````

Inline in text (flow context) — text wraps around a small scene:

````md
Some text {<GameScene wrap="square" align="left" width="80" height="80">
  <Block id="minecraft:grass" />
</GameScene>} and more text that wraps to the right.
````

## Example

````md
<GameScene width="256" height="160" zoom={4} perspective="isometric-north-east" interactive={true}>
  <Block id="minecraft:stone" />
  <Block id="minecraft:stone" x="1" />
  <Block id="minecraft:glass" z="1" />
</GameScene>
````

## Scene Child Elements

GuideNH currently registers these scene child tags:

- `<Block>`
- `<ImportStructure>`
- `<ImportStructureLib>`
- `<IsometricCamera>`
- `<RemoveBlocks>`
- `<ReplaceBlock>`
- `<PlaceBlock>`
- `<BlockAnnotationTemplate>`
- `<Entity>`
- annotation tags such as `<BoxAnnotation>` and `<LineAnnotation>`

## `<Block>`

Places a block into the preview world.

| Attribute | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes, unless `ore` is used | block id |
| `ore` | no | ore dictionary name; the first matching stack must resolve to a block item |
| `x` | no | integer world X, default `0` |
| `y` | no | integer world Y, default `0` |
| `z` | no | integer world Z, default `0` |
| `meta` | no | integer block metadata |
| `facing` | no | `down`, `up`, `north`, `south`, `west`, `east` |
| `nbt` | no | SNBT TileEntity compound |

Notes:

- `ore` takes precedence over `id`; if GregTech is installed, the chosen stack is unified through `GTOreDictUnificator.setStack(...)`
- if `meta` is omitted and an `ore` match carries concrete non-wildcard item damage, that damage is used before the `facing` fallback
- if `meta` is omitted, some blocks derive a sensible default from `facing`
- if `nbt` creates a TileEntity successfully, the preview uses it

Example:

````md
<Block id="minecraft:furnace" x="2" facing="south" />
<Block ore="logWood" x="3" />
<Block id="minecraft:chest" x="4" nbt="{id:\"Chest\",Items:[{Slot:0b,id:\"minecraft:diamond\",Count:1b,Damage:0s}]}" />
````

## `<ImportStructure>`

Loads an external structure file into the scene.

| Attribute | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | yes | structure asset path |
| `x` | no | integer translation X (alias for `offsetX`) |
| `y` | no | integer translation Y (alias for `offsetY`) |
| `z` | no | integer translation Z (alias for `offsetZ`) |
| `offsetX` | no | integer translation X (preferred over `x`) |
| `offsetY` | no | integer translation Y, clamped to `[0, worldHeight-1]` (preferred over `y`) |
| `offsetZ` | no | integer translation Z (preferred over `z`) |

Supported formats:

- SNBT text
- gzipped binary NBT
- uncompressed binary NBT

Required structure keys:

- `palette`
- `blocks`

Example:

````md
<ImportStructure src="/assets/example_structure.snbt" />
<ImportStructure src="/assets/example_structure.snbt" x="4" />
````

## `<ImportStructureLib>`

Imports a StructureLib multiblock preview by controller id.

| Attribute | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `controller` | yes | controller block id, using `modid:block[:meta]` |
| `piece` | no | StructureLib piece name override |
| `facing` | no | facing override passed to the importer |
| `rotation` | no | rotation override passed to the importer |
| `flip` | no | flip/mirror override passed to the importer |
| `channel` | no | integer channel override for channel-aware structures |
| `offsetX` | no | integer X offset applied to all placed blocks (default `0`) |
| `offsetY` | no | integer Y offset applied to all placed blocks, clamped to `[0, worldHeight-1]` (default `0`) |
| `offsetZ` | no | integer Z offset applied to all placed blocks (default `0`) |

Notes:

- the imported structure starts from scene `0 0 0`; the controller is not forced to be placed at `0 0 0`
- this tag enables StructureLib-specific tooltip, hatch highlight, and channel slider UI when metadata is available
- controller matching supports the GTNH-style `modid:block:meta` form

Example:

````md
<ImportStructureLib controller="botanichorizons:automatedCraftingPool" />
<ImportStructureLib controller="gregtech:gt.blockmachines:1000" channel="7" />
````

## `<IsometricCamera>`

Applies explicit isometric camera yaw/pitch/roll.

If this tag is omitted, the scene keeps using the `<GameScene>` `perspective` preset. The default
`isometric-north-east` preset is equivalent to:

````md
<IsometricCamera yaw="225" pitch="30" />
````

| Attribute | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `yaw` | float |
| `pitch` | float |
| `roll` | float |

Example:

````md
<IsometricCamera yaw="45" pitch="30" roll="0" />
````

## `<RemoveBlocks>`

Removes every already-placed block matching a target block id.

| Attribute | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | block id to remove, using `modid:block[:meta]` |

This is useful after importing a structure when you want to hide specific blocks for clarity.

Example:

````md
<ImportStructure src="/assets/example_structure.snbt" />
<RemoveBlocks id="minecraft:stone" />
<RemoveBlocks id="minecraft:stone:3" />
````

## `<ReplaceBlock>`

Replaces already-placed blocks that match a source block id (and optionally a partial tile entity NBT
pattern) with a new block. The search can be global (all filled blocks) or restricted to a
bounding box.

| Attribute | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `from` | yes | source block to match, using `modid:block[:meta]` |
| `from_nbt` | no | partial SNBT compound; a block matches only when its tile entity NBT contains all listed keys |
| `to` | yes | replacement block, using `modid:block[:meta]` |
| `to_nbt` | no | SNBT TileEntity compound to apply to the replacement |
| `x` | no | bounding box start X; if any of `x/y/z/dx/dy/dz` is present, the box mode is activated |
| `y` | no | bounding box start Y |
| `z` | no | bounding box start Z |
| `dx` | no | bounding box width (default `1`) |
| `dy` | no | bounding box height (default `1`) |
| `dz` | no | bounding box depth (default `1`) |

Notes:

- when none of `x/y/z/dx/dy/dz` are provided, all filled blocks are scanned globally
- `from_nbt` is a **partial** match: only the keys listed in the pattern must match; extra keys in
  the actual tile entity are ignored
- the replacement is performed via the same block placement pipeline as `<Block>`, so GregTech MetaTile
  and BartWorks tile entities are handled correctly

Example:

````md
<ImportStructure src="/assets/example_structure.snbt" />
<ReplaceBlock from="minecraft:stone" to="minecraft:glass" />
<ReplaceBlock from="minecraft:stone:1" to="minecraft:stone:2" x="0" y="0" z="0" dx="5" dy="3" dz="5" />
````

## `<PlaceBlock>`

Fills an axis-aligned box with a single block type, overwriting whatever was there before.
Unlike `<Block>` (which targets a single position), `<PlaceBlock>` supports multi-block regions via
`dx`/`dy`/`dz`.

| Attribute | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | block id, using `modid:block[:meta]` |
| `nbt` | no | SNBT TileEntity compound applied to every placed block |
| `x` | no | region start X, default `0` |
| `y` | no | region start Y, default `0` |
| `z` | no | region start Z, default `0` |
| `dx` | no | region width, default `1` |
| `dy` | no | region height, default `1` |
| `dz` | no | region depth, default `1` |

Notes:

- all blocks in the box are unconditionally placed (no prior-block check)
- the NBT compound is copied for each individual placement
- the same block placement pipeline as `<Block>` is used, so GregTech MetaTile and BartWorks tile entities
  are fully supported

Example:

````md
<PlaceBlock id="minecraft:stone" x="0" y="0" z="0" dx="5" dy="1" dz="5" />
<PlaceBlock id="minecraft:glass" y="1" dx="3" dz="3" />
````

## `<BlockAnnotationTemplate>`

Expands one or more child annotations onto every matching block that already exists in the current scene.

| Attribute | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | block matcher in `modid:block[:meta]` form |

Rules:

- place it after the blocks or imported structures that it should match
- matching happens against the current scene state at parse time
- child annotations use local coordinates relative to each matched block

Example:

````md
<ImportStructure src="/assets/example_structure.snbt" />
<BlockAnnotationTemplate id="minecraft:log">
  <DiamondAnnotation pos="0.5 0.5 0.5" color="#ff0000">
    Highlighted by template.
  </DiamondAnnotation>
</BlockAnnotationTemplate>
````

## `<Entity>`

Adds an entity to the preview scene.

The attributes follow summon-style entity placement and SNBT data.

| Attribute | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | entity type id; legacy names like `Sheep`, modern vanilla ids like `minecraft:sheep`, and registered mod entity ids in either `modid.entityName` or `modid:entityName` form are accepted |
| `x` | no | float X coordinate the entity is centered on, default `0.5` |
| `y` | no | float Y coordinate at the bottom of the entity, default `0` |
| `z` | no | float Z coordinate the entity is centered on, default `0.5` |
| `rotationY` | no | yaw in degrees, default `-45` |
| `rotationX` | no | pitch in degrees, default `0` |
| `data` | no | summon-style SNBT merged into the entity NBT before spawn |
| `baby` | no | boolean expression forcing supported entities into baby form; omitted leaves the entity's normal age/state unchanged |
| `name` | no | preview player name when `id` is `player`, `fakeplayer`, `minecraft:player`, or `minecraft:fakeplayer` |
| `uuid` | no | preview player UUID when using one of the player ids above |
| `showName` | no | boolean expression controlling the preview player nameplate, default `true` for player preview ids |
| `showCape` | no | boolean expression controlling the preview player cape, default `true` for player preview ids |
| `headRotation` | no | preview player head rotation as `x y z` degrees |
| `leftArmRotation` | no | preview player left arm rotation as `x y z` degrees |
| `rightArmRotation` | no | preview player right arm rotation as `x y z` degrees |
| `leftLegRotation` | no | preview player left leg rotation as `x y z` degrees |
| `rightLegRotation` | no | preview player right leg rotation as `x y z` degrees |
| `capeRotation` | no | preview player cape rotation as `x y z` degrees; defaults to the standing-still angle `6 0 0` |

Notes:

- entity bounds participate in scene auto-centering and visible-layer filtering
- entity creation falls back gracefully when the preview world is not ready yet, then binds on first render
- `baby={true}` currently supports preview players, ageable mobs, vanilla zombies, and modded entities that expose stable `setChild(boolean)` or `setBaby(boolean)` style APIs
- child-state entities are re-aligned to their current position after resizing so hover and pick bounds stay centered on the rendered model
- player preview ids create a client-side fake remote player so the normal player renderer and skin pipeline can be used
- when both `name` and `uuid` are omitted for a player preview, GuideNH falls back to `Steve` and the vanilla default skin
- when only `name` is given for a player preview, GuideNH first tries to resolve the real online profile so skins and capes can load; if lookup fails, it falls back to a stable offline UUID
- when only `uuid` is given for a player preview, GuideNH generates a placeholder display name and still tries to resolve the skin from the profile
- `showName={false}` hides the preview player's overhead name without bypassing the normal player renderer
- `showCape={false}` hides the preview player's cape while still respecting the normal player render path and Forge hooks
- player pose attributes use three space-separated floats mapped to model `X Y Z` rotation in degrees
- omitted head and limb rotation attributes keep the normal vanilla idle pose; omitted `capeRotation` falls back to the standing-still cape angle `6 0 0`
- player previews require an active client world at parse time because Minecraft's player entity constructor cannot be created worldless
- hovering an entity shows its localized display name, or its custom name if one was provided

Example:

````md
<GameScene zoom={4} interactive={true}>
  <Block id="minecraft:grass" />
  <Entity id="minecraft:sheep" y="1" data="{Color:2}" />
</GameScene>
````

Baby entity example:

````md
<GameScene zoom={4} interactive={true}>
  <Block id="minecraft:grass" />
  <Entity id="minecraft:sheep" y="1" baby={true} data="{Color:14}" />
  <Entity id="minecraft:zombie" x="1.5" y="1" baby={true} />
</GameScene>
````

Preview player pose example:

````md
<GameScene zoom={4} interactive={true}>
  <Block id="minecraft:grass" />
  <Entity
    id="player"
    y="1"
    name="ArtherSnow"
    headRotation="0 20 0"
    rightArmRotation="-35 0 0"
    leftArmRotation="10 0 -12"
    rightLegRotation="8 0 0"
    leftLegRotation="-8 0 0"
    capeRotation="12 0 0"
  />
</GameScene>
````

Preview player name and cape example:

````md
<GameScene zoom={4} interactive={true}>
  <Block id="minecraft:grass" />
  <Entity id="player" y="1" name="Huan_F" showName={true} showCape={true} />
  <Entity id="player" x="2" y="1" showName={false} showCape={false} />
</GameScene>
````

## Camera Center Behavior

If no explicit `centerX/Y/Z` is given, GuideNH auto-centers the scene from the placed block bounds. If any explicit center coordinate is set, auto-centering is disabled and missing coordinates default to `0`.

## Interaction Notes

When `interactive={true}` the scene supports rotation, pan, zoom, reset, annotation toggles, and other UI controls exposed by the guide screen.

- scenes spanning multiple Y levels show a visible-layer slider above the bottom edge
- StructureLib scenes can add a hatch-highlight toggle button plus a channel slider at the very bottom when the imported metadata provides them
- annotation hover takes priority over block hover; block tooltips appear normally once no annotation hotspot is being hovered
- StructureLib hover keeps the block name on the first tooltip line, adds structure-specific text starting on the second line, and expands replacement candidates when `Shift` is held
